## Marketing

### **eCommerce Business Model**
Our business model is focused on providing an online platform for artists to showcase and sell their artwork to customers around the world. By connecting artists with potential buyers, we create a thriving marketplace for unique contemporary art.

### **Purpose of the Application**
The purpose of the application is to simplify the process of discovering, buying, and selling art. It offers a user-friendly interface for artists to upload their work and manage their profiles, while customers can easily browse, search, and purchase art pieces that resonate with them.

### **B2B or B2C Focused**
The application is primarily B2C focused, catering to individual customers who wish to purchase art pieces for their personal enjoyment or as gifts. However, we also provide opportunities for B2B relationships, such as collaborations with art galleries, interior designers, and corporate clients looking for unique art pieces for their spaces.

### **Core Business Intents**
- Providing a diverse collection of contemporary art pieces for customers to explore and purchase
- Offering a platform for talented artists to showcase their work and gain exposure
- Simplifying the art buying process for customers through a user-friendly interface and secure payment options
- Facilitating communication and collaboration between artists, buyers, and other stakeholders in the art world

### **Marketing Strategies for the Application**
- **Blogs**: Regularly publish blog articles on topics related to art, artists, and the art world to attract visitors and improve SEO ranking.
- **Social media**: Leverage platforms like Facebook and Instagram to share images of featured artworks, artist profiles, and upcoming events to engage with the audience.
- **Email campaigns**: Send out newsletters to subscribers, informing them about new arrivals, featured artists, promotions, and special events.
- **Influencer marketing**: Collaborate with art influencers and bloggers to promote the platform and its artists to a wider audience.
- **Partnerships**: Partner with local galleries, museums, and art events to gain exposure and drive traffic to the platform.
- **SEO optimization**: Optimize the website and its content(blog and artwork detail pages) for search engines to rank higher and attract more organic traffic.

### Facebook Mockup
A Facebook mockup page has been created to showcase the platform's latest updates, featured artists, events, and promotional content. This will serve as a key marketing channel for reaching and engaging with potential customers.

## User Stories

User stories are based on four types of users: anonymous users, buyer users, seller users, and staff users.

- Anonymous users are defined as those who are not authenticated but have limited access to the web application.
- Buyer users are defined as those who have not marked themselves as a seller upon sign up but have access to more features across the web application.
- Seller users are defined as those users who signed up as selling property and, therefore, have access to more features across the web application.
- Staff users are defined as those users whose accounts have been created by admin in the backend, and who have been marked as "is_staff" and as a result having access to the blog features of the web application.
  - **Note:** These accounts can _only_ be made in the backend using the admin panel. They are treated as employee accounts and thus can only be made for special use, unlike the previous two users.

### Example User Stories

1. As a visitor, I can browse through the available artworks and products, so that I can find and select items to purchase.
2. As a registered user, I can add products to my shopping cart, so that I can review and purchase them later.
3. As a staff member, I can edit and delete blog posts, so that I can manage the content on the website efficiently.
4. As an administrator, I can have a reliable backend infrastructure, so that the e-commerce site functions properly and manages data efficiently.

Milestones, Issues, User Stories, Tasks, and Acceptance Criteria can be found in the [GitHub repository project Kanban board](https://github.com/users/AVTpepper/projects/5).


## Manual Testing

### Responsiveness Testing

* The website's responsiveness was tested using Google Chrome Developer Tools' device emulator and by manually resizing the browser window. Various devices and screen sizes were tested to ensure that the layout and elements adapt correctly.

### Browser Compatibility Testing

* The website was tested on multiple browsers, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge, to ensure compatibility and consistent user experience.

### Bugs
There have been several coding challenges under the entirety of the project. However, at this point in time when writing the README, I either have resolved the bugs or they remain unresolved.

#### Resolved Bugs

* Issue with navigation menu on mobile devices
    * _Solution: Implemented a responsive navigation menu using Bootstrap._

* Image resizing issues on smaller screens
    * _Solution: Adjusted the CSS to make images responsive and maintain their aspect ratio._
* Padding and margins added for several pages to view the content.

#### Unresolved Bugs
- On the blog post detail page, for each comment that was shown they all were added the same ID. I wasnt able to figure out how to give them seperate ids. Therefore this is a bug that I will want to fix at a later point.
- The W3C CSS Validator Service returned 1 error and 719 warnings. All the warnings came bcause of vendor extensions, and mostly from using bootstrap classes.
- I got this error when using Jshint on my JS files, and I am not sure how to fix it:
"Functions declared within loops referencing an outer scoped variable may lead to confusing semantics. (currentPage, i, paginateArtworks)".
- Country field selection on profile page got a weird background color and bad contrast with the changing font color.



### Lighthouse Testing Outcomes

* Lighthouse was used to evaluate the website's performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO. Based on the results, several improvements were made, such as optimizing images, enhancing contrast, and adding descriptive alt text to images.

### Code Validation

* HTML code was validated using the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/).
* CSS code was validated using the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).
* JavaScript code was validated using [JSHint](https://jshint.com/).
* Python code was validated using `pycodestyle` linter in the development environment.

### User Stories Testing

* Each user story was tested to ensure that it met the acceptance criteria and provided the intended user experience. The results were documented and used to guide the development process.

### Features Testing

* Each feature of the application was tested to ensure that it functioned correctly and met the project requirements. This included testing forms, navigation, and user authentication.

## Deployment Procedures

This project was deployed using GitHub and Heroku.

### GitHub

1. Start a new repository.
   - Log in to GitHub.
   - Click the blue book icon.
   - Choose a template (I used the Code Institute template as recommended).
   - Add a repository name and click "Create repository" at the bottom of the page.
   - Then, click the Gitpod button.

### Gitpod and Django

1. Install Django and other necessary libraries:
   - Use `pip install Django` to install Django.
   - Install any other required libraries.
2. Write your code.
3. Create a `.env` file for sensitive data and add it to the `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being publicly accessible.
4. Generate a `requirements.txt` file by running `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`.
5. Create a `Procfile`.

### Heroku

1. Log in to Heroku.
2. Click the "New" button, then select "New app".
3. Choose a unique app name and region, then click "Create app".
4. Go to "Settings" and click "Reveal Config Vars". Here, enter all the sensitive data, database addresses, and other URLs used in the project.
5. Go back to the top and click on "Deploy", then select "GitHub".
6. Scroll down and click on "Connect to GitHub".
7. Search for your GitHub repository name by typing it in the search field.
8. Click on "Connect".
9. Scroll down and click on "Deploy Branch".
10. Once the app is built with Python and all the dependencies, you'll see a message that says "The app was successfully deployed".
11. Click on "View" to see the [deployed site](https://avtpepper-onestop-artist-shop.herokuapp.com/).

### AWS S3 Bucket Creation

1. Sign up for an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account if you haven't already.
2. Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
3. Click "Create bucket" and choose a unique name for your bucket.
4. Select the appropriate region for your bucket and configure its settings as needed (e.g., enable public access, configure CORS, etc.).
5. Create an IAM user with programmatic access and the necessary permissions for managing your S3 bucket.
6. Save the IAM user's access key and secret access key, and add them as environment variables in your project and Heroku app.

### Stripe Configuration

1. Sign up for a Stripe account and log in.
2. Navigate to the "Developers" section and click "API keys".
3. Obtain your "Publishable key" and "Secret key" and add them as environment variables in your project and Heroku app.
4. In your Django project, configure the Stripe settings (e.g., initialize the Stripe API with your API keys, set up webhooks, etc.).
5. Test your Stripe integration using the provided test card numbers and ensure it's working as expected.

By following these procedures, you should be able to successfully set up your development environment, deploy your app on Heroku, configure AWS S3 for media storage, and integrate Stripe for payments.
